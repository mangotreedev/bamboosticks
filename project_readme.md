Testing philosophy is based off off the Classic Approach or Chicago School a.k.a Inside Out TDD.

The levels covered range from unit/models, requests, and features.  It also includes additional coverage along jobs, mailers, presenters, and services.

The primary toolset is managed by rspec; test data is managed by factorybot; coverage is managed by simplecov; cleaning is managed by database_cleaner; and additional services are provided by shoulda-matchers.

The primary web driver is handled by capybara.

If you implement any new features please validate all tests pass prior to pushing your branch.  If you submit a pull request please validate all test pass successfully on the github action workflow.  You should see a green check by the last commit if all tests have passed.


## Visual Design Philosophy

[PLEASE REPLACE]

Insert App Summary (1-2 paragraphs) and list out main facets of the application with brief descriptions

[PLEASE REPLACE]

We've generated a Kitchensink route, controller action, and view to populate with front-end components. Every time you are using a component make sure you use the ones from the kitchen sink (or add them if you are creating new ones).

## External Services

## Contributing

If you are joining the team and wish to contribute please follow three simple philosophies
1) Maintain code coverage levels, following the inside out approach
2) Descriptive pull requests using the built in template, and no one merges their own requests
3) Follow any and all design patterns or philosophies when available
