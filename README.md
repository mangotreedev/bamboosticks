# MangoTree Rails Template: BambooSticks

## Description :speak_no_evil:
BambooSticks is the template we use at MangoTree to generate RoR applications with a basic setup suitable for most web applications.  We hope this template supports you as you begin your application development, just as bamboo sticks support a fledgling plant.  

If you would like to see something added in or want to understand more on why we made certain decisions please don't hesitate to raise an issue!
