# MangoTree Rails Template: BambooSticks

## Description :speak_no_evil:
BambooSticks is the template we use at MangoTree to generate RoR applications with a basic setup suitable for most web applications.  We hope this template supports you as you begin your application development, just as bamboo sticks support a fledgling plant.

It will take you through a decision tree on which front end framework you want to use, whether or not you want to add devise for authentication, pundit for authorization, and stimulus for JS; so make sure you pay attention while your app is generating!

If you would like to see something added in or want to understand more on why we made certain decisions please don't hesitate to raise an issue!
